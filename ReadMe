This project mainly focuses on classifying whether a github user is ML Developer or a Web developer using Graph Neural Network
Refer problem_description for more info

Go with this flow for understanding the project in a sequential manner
0) data_analysis --> file used to select the good nodes
1) graph_creation --> creating graph out the selected nodes
2) model_creation_training --> developing and training the model with the developed graph
3) Inference --> used for getting the output

Contribution Area :
Developers who are interested in contributing to this project can contribute in the following areas for the further improvement
* preprocessing the node's feature vector
* Graph creation strategy
* making a website to visualize and interact with graph (see the graph_data_creation.ipynb)
* Model architecture

Note : Already proposed few strategies for preprocessing and graph data creation
Currently working on : GNN Model Building and optimization
