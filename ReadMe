Go with this flow for understanding the project in a sequential manner
0) Read problem_description.ipynb --> to understand the problem and the data
1) data_analysis --> file used to select the good nodes
2) graph_creation --> creating graph out the selected nodes
3) model_creation_training --> developing and training the model with the developed graph
4) Inference --> used for getting the output

Contribution Area :
Developers who are interested in contributing to this project can contribute in the following areas for the further improvement
* preprocessing the node's feature vector
* Graph creation strategy
* making a website to visualize and interact with graph (see the graph_data_creation.ipynb)
* Model architecture


I am currently working on building a GNN for a node level with the generated graph data(see graph_data_creation.ipynb)
